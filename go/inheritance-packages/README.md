# Inheritance across Packages w/ Structs

This demo will attempt to show how a base "class" can be created using
an interface that allows access to the base struct even if the derived
classes implement the (inner) struct with a super type of the base
struct.

In short: inheritance w/ attributes, not just an interface -- kinda.
