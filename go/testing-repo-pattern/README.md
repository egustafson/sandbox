Golang Package of Just Tests
============================

This example, and directory will show how a separate Golang repo, and
module, can be constructed with just tests, and possibly supporting
code for tests.

Directory:  testlib   # a Golang module with some demo test func's.
Directory:  testrepo  # a Golang module with "just tests"
